## My process

I try to go for mobile-first workflow. I made the header and navigation first. The overflay for the navigation bar was difficult to create. I was not able to make the navigation bar take the whole width as a result the user could scroll. After searching in stackoverflow I was able to make the navigation bar take whole screen. I used flexbox for creating interactive section and footer section. The creations section was built using css grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to make an overlay take whole width of the screen and also brushed up on my CSS grid skills. 

```js
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]. style .height = "100vh";
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]. style. overflow = "hidden";
```


### Continued development

I think I need to focus on using CSS grid more. I need to see examples everytime when I try to incorporate CSS grid.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I always use css-tricks whenever I forget any layout sytax.
